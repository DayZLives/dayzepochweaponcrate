dayzepochweaponcrate
====================

Create a weapon crate from config. Automatic selection of correct ammo and muzzles.

Usage: [250] execVM "weaponCrates.sqf";

Will create 12 weapon crates stacked with weapons (selected from your current mod config files using cfgWeapons). The script will then find the correct ammo and, if any, muzzles for each weapon and stock the crate with those too. That way when you grab a weapon you get a load of ammo to go with it :)

Within the script there are arrays that are randomly picked from to add Food, Vehicle Repair, Drink and General Items. Also adds backpacks and Skins..

Was originally made for a deathmatch event at fragLANd.co.uk
